# Contributing to StereoCrafter WEBUI

## 🎯 About This Project

This is a **web-based UI fork** of the original [StereoCrafter](https://github.com/TencentARC/StereoCrafter) project by Tencent ARC Lab and by [Enoky](https://github.com/enoky/StereoCrafter) for the GUI implementation. This version is tested with a minimum RTX 6000 Ada ( Lovelace architecture ) and 48GB VRAM.

### Why a Web UI?

The original StereoCrafter uses CLI and Enoky tkinter-based desktop GUIs, which work great locally but have limitations:

- **Limited to local hardware** - You're stuck with the GPU you bought. You cannot increase the VRAM.
- **No remote access** - You can't process videos from anywhere.
- **Resource intensive** - High-end GPUs are expensive to own. Yet they output results faster.
- **OS, Batch and UI** - StereoCrafter is command-line usage only and can't do batch video file processing. Enoky is GUI-based and batch-processing enabled, but the python code is optimized for Windows 10/11 and might generate errors running on Linux/MacOS.

### Our Solution: Cloud-Ready Web Interface

By converting to a **Gradio-based web UI**, we enabled:

✅ **RunPod Integration** - Access high-end GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000) for pennies per hour  
✅ **Remote Processing** - Process videos from any device with a browser  
✅ **Cost Effective** - Pay only for GPU time you use, not ownership  
✅ **Scalability** - Spin up multiple instances for batch processing  
✅ **Accessibility** - Share processing power with team members  

**Example Cost Savings:**
- RTX 4090 ownership: ~$1,600 upfront
- RunPod RTX 4090: ~$0.50/hour (only when processing)
- Process 10 hours/month: $5 vs $1,600 investment

### Honorable Mention

All credit for the core StereoCrafter technology goes to the original authors at **Tencent ARC Lab**. This project simply wraps their excellent work in a web interface for cloud deployment.

### Project Status

⚠️ **This is a passion project built in free time!**

This codebase is:
- **Functional but not optimized** - It works, but there's room for improvement
- **Built with enthusiasm** - Created out of love for the technology, not commercial purposes
- **Community-driven** - Your contributions can help make it better!

We welcome optimizations, bug fixes, and feature improvements. This is a learning project for everyone involved!

*   **Key:** `HF_TOKEN`
*   **Value:** `your huggingface read token`

### 5. Deploy
*   Click **Set Overrides**
*   Select **Deploy On-Demand**

## 🚀 Local Setup 
Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you set up the project locally, make changes, and submit your contributions.
### 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Git**: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Python 3.12**: [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads)
- **CUDA 12.8**: [Download here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-8-0-download-archive) (for GPU support)
- **FFmpeg**: [Installation guide](https://techtactician.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-and-add-it-to-path-on-windows/)
- **HuggingFace Account**: [Sign up here](https://huggingface.co/join) (HF_TOKEN needed for model downloads)

Verify installations:
```bash
git --version
python --version
ffmpeg -version
```

### Step 1: Clone the Original StereoCrafter Repository

```bash
# Clone the original repository
git clone https://github.com/enoky/StereoCrafter.git
cd StereoCrafter

# Checkout the specific commit we're based on
git checkout 2a1d473
```

**Why this specific commit?**

This WEBUI was developed and tested against commit `2a1d473` of enoky's StereoCrafter fork. This commit is known to be stable and compatible with our web interface.

**Can I use a newer commit?**

Yes, you can try! As long as the core pipeline structure remains the same, newer commits should work. To use the latest:

```bash
# Skip this step
git checkout 2a1d473
# if you already did, simply. to fetch latest pull
git pull
```

**UPDATE** : Latest commit tested successfully. No errors found `1026d0d` 26 FEB 2026

However, if you encounter issues with newer commits:
- The pipeline API might have changed
- New dependencies might be required
- File paths or function signatures might differ

If you want to help test compatibility with newer commits, that's a great contribution! Just note which commit you're using when reporting issues.

### Step 2: Clone the WEBUI Patch Repository

```bash
# Clone the WEBUI repository (in a separate location)
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/keemzin/WEBUI-StereoCrafter.git
```

### Step 3: Merge/Replaced all WEBUI Files into StereoCrafter

```bash
# Copy WEBUI files into the StereoCrafter folder
# This preserves the original StereoCrafter files and adds WEBUI components
cd StereoCrafter
cp -r ../WEBUI-StereoCrafter/gui ./
cp -r ../WEBUI-StereoCrafter/stereocrafter_ui ./
cp ../WEBUI-StereoCrafter/webui.py ./
cp ../WEBUI-StereoCrafter/requirements.txt ./
```

**Windows users:** use File Explorer to copy/repalce everything the folders or can use xcopy:
```cmd
xcopy /E /I ..\WEBUI-StereoCrafter\gui .\gui
xcopy /E /I ..\WEBUI-StereoCrafter\stereocrafter_ui .\stereocrafter_ui
copy ..\WEBUI-StereoCrafter\webui.py .
copy ..\WEBUI-StereoCrafter\requirements.txt .
```

### Step 4: Download Model Weights

Create a `weights` folder and download the required models:

```bash
# Create weights folder
mkdir weights
cd weights

# Download models using git
git clone https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/StereoCrafter
git clone https://huggingface.co/tencent/DepthCrafter
git clone https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1

cd ..
```

### Step 5: Set Up Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Step 6: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 7: Run the WEBUI

```bash
# Start the web interface
python webui.py
```

The WEBUI will open in your browser at `http://localhost:7860`
